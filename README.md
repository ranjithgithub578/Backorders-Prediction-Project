# Backorder Prediction Using AI

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a product will go on backorder based on inventory, sales forecasts, and supply chain indicators.

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras

## How to Run
1. Open `Backorder_Prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run all cells to load the data, train the model, and see predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset (`BackOrders.csv`) contains information on inventory levels, lead times, constraints, and backorder status.
